This simulation is consistent with pH=0, U=0.0 vs RHE, PH2=1atm. 

So the rate of adsorption of H+ and desorption of H2 should be equilibrated. 

Here I am introducing artificially the effect of entropy from the Eyring-Polanyi equation. 
  Now it is much closer to equilibrium, still with an ofset of two orders of magnitude.

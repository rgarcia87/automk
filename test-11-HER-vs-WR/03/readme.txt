This simulation is consistent with pH=0, U=0.0 vs RHE, PH2=1atm. 

So the rate of adsorption of H+ and desorption of H2 should be equilibrated. 

Here I am introducing artificially the effect of entropy from the Eyring-Polanyi equation. 
  Now it is much closer to equilibrium, still with an ofset of two orders of magnitude.  

"c" and "d" sets are ridiculously worse. Specially because H+ pressure is much higher. 

Apparently there could be a mistake in equation 101d&i.

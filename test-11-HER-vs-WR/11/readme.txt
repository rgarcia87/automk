Here I am considering the thickness of the second layer @ double-layer as 4.5Å,
    so the surface concentration of a mol/L is equivalent to 0.017889.
Solubility of H2: 0.0015g/L = 0.75E-3M ~ "theta"=1.34E-5.

But this result is numerically almost equal that test#10. Very very unsettling.

Further tests #2 and #3 reveals that introducing entropy always worsens the results.
    And equilibrium is reached just by adding ~+0.04 eV of entropy to H⁺ desorption.           
    A bit more just makes the result break.

As currently this is equivalent to using the Hertz-Knudsen equation, I'll just keep it.

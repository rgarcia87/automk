This simulation is consistent with pH=0, U=0.0 vs RHE, PH2=1atm. 

So the rate of adsorption of H+ and desorption of H2 should be equilibrated. 

a: entropy correction added, but in the wrong sense. 
b: entropy correction correctly added. Nasty results. 
c: no entropy correction. 

WARNING!!! Hydrogen adsorption must be corrected!!!

"""This package generates the Input of a microkinetic model to be used in Maple.  
   
Future modules: 
    * Reactor behaviour as a function of time. 
    * Inherit initial conditions (preconverge).  
    * Non-isothermal reactors, T dependent on time. 
    * Non-isobaric   reactors, P dependent on time.  
    * Deactivation of key intermediates: Sensibility analysis.  
    * Cycle the model making the energies depend on two or more parameters (PCA). 
    * Consider coverage effects.

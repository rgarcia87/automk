"""This package generates the Input of microkinetic models for Maple.  
   
Possible expansions:  
    * Non-isothermal reactors, T dependent on time. 
    * Non-isobaric   reactors, P dependent on time.  
    * Cycle the model making the energies depend on two or more parameters (PCA). 
    * Consider coverage effects.    
    * Put area of active site.

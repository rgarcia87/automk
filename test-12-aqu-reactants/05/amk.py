"""This package generates the Input of microkinetic models for Maple.  
   
Possible expansions:  
    * Put is and fs as lists, to support H2 dissociative adsorption for instance.
    * Non-isothermal reactors, T dependent on time. 
    * Non-isobaric   reactors, P dependent on time.   
    * Cycle the model making the energies depend on two or more parameters (PCA). 
    * Consider coverage effects.    
    * Unidimensional diffusion, taking stationary state conditions in Fick's law. 
Security checks to implement: 
    * Check if float(conf['Catalyst']['areaactivesite']) gives no error. 
    * Idem float(conf['Catalyst']['secondlayerthickness']) if gas-phase species.
